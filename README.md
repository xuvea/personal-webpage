# Web Dev Final Project

## Alissa Friel

### About
This website is a personal website that I made. It introduces myself and informs the reader of my skills, education, experience, and projects I have worked on. It also allows the reader to contact me at the bottom of the page if they wish (not fully implemented).

For the development of the website I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

### To Run
This website uses GitHub pages, and is accessable from https://xuvea.github.io/personal-webpage/
